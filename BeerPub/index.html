               <h1>Welcome to our Growling Beer Pub</h1>
               <p>Pours smooth and creamy into the glass. The beer is an opaque and murky straw-amber color, topped with a thick and creamy foam head. Lacing is nice, with some glass-clinging action going on, and more than ample head retention. What's odd about the appearance is the amount of yeast in suspension. Even when chilled for days, the yeast is still hanging in there, when typically it would settle. Something is keeping it floating around, and it aint Mother Nature. Rich, golden color with dark amber and orange hues and a touch of chill haze that clears as the beer warms. Carbonation is quite active, with abnormally large bubbles frothing into a thick white foam head that piles high, sticks and leaves a healthy lacing. Steely and mineral in the nose, soft and powdery, with a dusting of herbal and malty-sweet suggestions. Very smooth on the palate; even and medium-bodied. Malty with bready and biscuity notes running through a light and toasty sweetness. An aggressive alcohol cuts through with spice and a burn, prickling the palate. Distinct herbal hops characters meet the alcohol spice and meld well. Faint taste of ripe stone fruit beneath. Toasty finish, slightly drying, powdery dash of spices.</p>
			   <p>Brought to us in 16-ounce pints on tap, the condensation-covered glass and dim lighting yielded a shimmering copper-colored brew with a tawny center and a slight touch of haze. Atop the brew, a wonderful tight lacing with more than ample head retention and stick. Aroma is big, with notes of resinous pine, grapefruit, distinct fruit cocktail characters and caramelized sugars spread on toasted bread.<p>
